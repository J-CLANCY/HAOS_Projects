# Home Assistant OS Projects
Repository for the HAOS projects undertaken by (mostly) Dynamize100 and (less so) I.

## Example Project Structure

Each project will have its own entry in the projects folder, where the following project structure should be expected.

```
HAOS_PROJECTNAME
│   README.md
└───docs # Documentations for the project
│
└───3D_Design # CAD files for the project's case, mechanical or structural components.
│   
└───PCB_Design # EDA files for the project's PCB or schematic.
|
└───res # Static resources used throughout the project. 
|
└───Software_Design # YAML files for the project's HAOS integration or other software required to make it beep-boop.
|
└───tools # Tools, utilities and conveniences for the project
```
